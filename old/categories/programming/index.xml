That&amp;rsquo;s okay. I&amp;rsquo;ll just do it myself. After trying multiple ideas, there seems to be one big concession I needed to make. Since Hugo has no ability to call outside executables, there needs to be two pipelines that are happening at the same time. While not optimal, the final product actually works pretty well.</description></item></channel></rss>

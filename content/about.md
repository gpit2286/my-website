Kyle previously served as Assistant Conductor for the Bay Area Rainbow Symphony. In these positions, Kyle is dedicated to building community by recognizing diversity, fostering inclusion, and promoting excellence.

Kyle has acquired a diverse background in conducting that allows him to create exciting and meaningful musical experiences. Kyle’s experience includes conducting symphony orchestras, wind ensembles, opera, chamber ensembles, and dance ensembles. Attending both international and domestic conducting seminars, Kyle has had the opportunity to work with leading conducting educators including Paul Vermel, Peter Jaffe, Maurice Peress, and Neil Thomson.

When not poring over his musical work, Kyle enjoys the problem solving involved with computer programming. During COVID shutdowns, Kyle even felt it was necessary (it was not) to create an introductory website and set of videos for people wanting to learn more about [32-bit ARM assembly](https://armasm.com). Kyle is always trying to expand his abilities and knowledge and is currently in pursuit of becoming a polyglot. Kyle currently lives in San Francisco with his partner and cat, 봄.
